# RDKIT-Analysis
RDKit is a powerful and open-source cheminformatics toolkit written in C++ and Python. This tool was used to screen and manipulate chemical compounds using PubChemPy.
Features:
Molecular Manipulation:
Reading and writing molecular file formats (SMILES, SDF, etc.).
Editing molecular structures and generating 2D/3D coordinates.
Descriptors and Fingerprints:
Calculating molecular properties and descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, LogP).
Substructure Searching:
Identifying functional groups and substructure matches in molecules.
Integration with Python:
Extensively used with Python for scripting, machine learning, and automation
